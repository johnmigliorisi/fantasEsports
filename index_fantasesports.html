		<h2>Fantasy Spots + Video Games</h2>
		<p>I have the good fortune of being involved with a great community of gamers over at <a href="http://www.houseofcarpe.com/forums/">House of Carpe.</a> Each year, HOC hosts two Unreal Tournament 2004 Tournaments. Well, during the winter tourney in 2015, one of my teammates made an off the cuff remark about how it would be cool if we could play fantasy UT by picking the players in the tournaments to fill out our fantasy teams. I thought that sounded cool too, so I thought I would code it up as a way to shake off the layers of rust that had built up over the last few years while I have been in management and not coding for a living anymore.</p>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>It works the same as any fantasy sport. People that are interested in playing will be able to sign up, make a league, and see what tournaments are currently running. They will be able to pick a tournament to attach their league to, and invite their friends to join. They will be able to create their rosters based on the players that are active in that tournament and have their league season match the tournament. I'm not yet sure how I will handle drafting, I still have some stuff to figure out...</p>
