# fantasEsports
This is a simple application based on the fantasy sports genre. The athletes though, will be video gamers.
I am building this to try to shake off the years of rust (soooo much rust) and get back into programming. Also hoping it will be fun for my friends in the Unreal Tournament 2004 community - shout out to House of Carpe and Slice of Life!
